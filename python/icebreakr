mychildhood was joyous, i wish !!!
I am the guy who loves all
when I'm in the mood

I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.
My fasion sense is unparalelled.
I speak my mind. I never mind what I speak.
Yes I am weird, weird is good. Normal is overrated.
Sometimes I wish my mouth had a Pause button...
My ethics are so clear and transparent that you can't even see them.
I'm so hilarious. I'm the only one who gets my jokes.
I had two breakups in college one with Probability theory and the other one with engineering drawing. 

I was once described, in the "needs improvement" part of an appraisal review.
Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. 
I know im sounding cliched to some of you and nonsensical to most of you,but the truth is iam only reciting memorized lines.
